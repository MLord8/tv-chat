#chaTV

##Connect. Chat. React.
chaTV allows users across the internet to congregate and discuss what's happening on television in real time. Currently airing programs can be searched, leading to a show specific chat room where users can interact with each other and react to events that occur on television as they occur. Using Microsoft Cognitive Services Text Analytics API, messages in the chat are evaluated and an aggregate rating based on the overall mood of the conversation is calculated and displayed.

> ##### chaTV was created for HackGT 2016, made with love by Manoaj Kandiakounder, Matt Lord, Nikhil Ramesh, and Noah Rickles.
